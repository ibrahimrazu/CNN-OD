Self explorative network for classification
An algorithmic approach to optimize Convolutional Neural Network structure for efficient loss optimization
A Pytorch based optimization algorithm was developed to perform efficient loss computation and optimization. The repository contains the source code running the
MNIST dataset which has a dimension of 28*28 for each image. This classification problem is analysed with a deep convolutional neural network.
